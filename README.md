# heart-attack-ml-classification-project
# Commitment

This project has been created for educational purposes and is not intended to be used for professional or any other reason.

## Main Goal
Training ML models to classify the characteristics for each people and their possibility of heart attack. In the end, my intention is to find the best model that fit the data. 

### Dataset Information
In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com.

The dataset I choose was cleaned.The cleaned data set contains information of 14 attributes:
1) age
2) sex: 0 = female, 1 = male
3) cp = chest pain type (4 values)
4) trestbps = resting blood pressure
5) chol =  serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6) fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7) testecg =  resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8) thalach =  maximum heart rate achieved
9) exang =  exercise induced angina
10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11) slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12) ca =  number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14) target: 0 = less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
